                  <p>
                    The general approach is to use a graph based data structure
                    along with bread first search algorithm which is generally
                    used to find a path between point A to B. In order to find
                    the shortest path between point two points we have to
                    introduce a cost function, a more well known variant of
                    which is Djikstra's Algorithm, which is guarantee to give
                    the shortest path.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    The problem in question uses Djikstra's algorithm with a
                    slight variation in finding edges/neighbours which is the
                    key insight to it. It is also important to note that a
                    Priority Queue is more appropriate than a normal Queue,
                    using Priority Queue will lead towards faster computing
                    time.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    The problems asks to find the shortest amount of moves or
                    turns to reach the goal. This can be done by changing the
                    way we get neighbours, in standard Grid BFS neighbours are
                    immediate top, bottom, right and left cells. We change this
                    approach to include all cells to top, bottom, right and left
                    directions until a wall cell or end of grid is reached.
                  </p>
                  <p>The rest is standard Djikstra's Algoritm.</p>
